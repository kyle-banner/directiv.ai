                <div class="post-body">
                    <p>In <em>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</em>, the Infinite Improbability Drive is the core of
                        The Heart of Gold, the crew's interstellar spaceship. It's the key component that makes wildly
                        unlikely jumps possible in an instant while the ship itself provides structure, controls, and
                        safety.</p>
                    <p>An LLM plays the same role as the drive: it generates powerful, probabilistic possibilities in an
                        instance. But the LLM cannot own state, enforce rules, or safely handle failure on its own. When
                        you mistake the drive for the ship, you get chaos. When you mistake the LLM for your app, you
                        get chaos. However, if the drive is contained within a well-built space ship with navigation
                        controls and a competent pilot, you get where you want to go in an instant. Similarly, if you
                        can contain your LLM inside a deterministic application, you get something that actually
                        survives first contact with the user in production.</p>
                    <p>The Heart of Gold didn't need a better drive, and enterprises don't need a smarter model.
                        Enterprises need deterministic systems that can safely contain probabilistic components.</p>
                    <p>In 2026 most enterprise GenAI app failures are not model quality problems. These failures are a
                        result of determinism and control-plane problems. Enterprises are trying to apply probabilistic
                        systems to deterministic workflows without introducing the missing architectural components.</p>
                    <p>For an effective system using GenAI, you need deterministic envelopes around probabilistic
                        cores. LLMs should be pure functions inside a deterministic orchestration layer. Inputs, tool
                        calls, outputs, and side effects must be versioned, replayable, and diffable.</p>
                    <p>The LLM should never be allowed to directly mutate enterprise systems. The model should only
                        propose actions inside a deterministic orchestration layer that enforces policy, versioning,
                        idempotency, and evaluation gates.</p>
                    <p>This is where policy engines like Open Policy Agent fit cleanly. OPA gives you a deterministic
                        decision point: Is this action allowed? Does it require approval? What constraints apply? The
                        model doesn't answer those questions. Your architecture does.</p>
                    <p>Every input, tool call, and output should be written to an append-only run ledger so executions
                        are replayable and auditable. Probabilistic systems may only propose commands; deterministic
                        systems decide and record. Side effects happen only through deterministic tool executors with
                        idempotency keys (so retries do not duplicate actions), and higher-risk actions are routed to a
                        human approval queue.</p>

                        <figcaption>Keep probabilistic cores inside deterministic envelopes.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>And yes, it's tempting to say “we'll just route everything to a human.” That feels safe, but it
                        creates its own failure modes. More on that in a future post.</p>
                    <p>GenAI feels wrong in enterprises because it is being sprayed across workflows without changing
                        the underlying system architecture. We are inserting probabilistic components into environments
                        that were designed for determinism, auditability, and control. Then we are pretending nothing
                        needs to change.</p>
                    <p>This is not an AI maturity problem. It is a systems design failure. GenAI feels wrong in
                        enterprises because we're treating it like the app itself when it should be treated more like
                        infrastructure.</p>
                    <p>The companies getting this right aren't “using more AI.” They're redesigning the systems around
                        AI. They know that probabilistic systems should only propose commands; deterministic systems
                        decide and record.</p>
                    <p>Get this right and you're the Heart of Gold. Get it wrong and you're the bowl of petunias, with
                        just enough time for one last thought: “oh no, not again.”
